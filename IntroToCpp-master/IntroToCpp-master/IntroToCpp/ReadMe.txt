The files you should look at are:

	
IntroToCpp.cpp
    
	Main project file.

ObjectWithoutHeader.cpp
    
	ObjectWithoutHeader class. 
	Name is self-explanatory; this is for an object that uses just the .cpp file and not the .h file. 
	Also contains a struct and an enum.

ObjectWithHeader.cpp
    
	ObjectWithHeader class. Name is self-explanatory. Contains the implementation of the methods.

ObjectWithHeader.h
    
	ObjectWithHeader header file. Contains the actual class, declaration of methods, and member variables.
